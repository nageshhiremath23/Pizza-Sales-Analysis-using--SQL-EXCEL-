Pizza Sales Analysis Project: SQL + MS Excel 📊💻

Hello Connections!

I’m excited to share my end-to-end project on Pizza Sales Analysis, utilizing SQL and MS Excel to gain actionable insights from the data.

Project Overview
1️⃣ Data Cleaning:
I started with data cleaning to ensure accuracy by removing duplicates and handling blank spaces in the CSV file. This step was crucial to maintain data integrity throughout the analysis.

2️⃣ Data Processing:
To enhance the depth of analysis, I added two new columns—specific day and time of pizza delivery—to gain better insights into order patterns.

3️⃣ SQL Analysis:
The cleaned data was imported into MS SQL Server, where I executed various queries to extract meaningful outputs based on key business questions. (Refer to the attached SQL queries for details.)

4️⃣ Excel Visualization:
I transitioned to MS Excel to present the findings through pivot tables and visually engaging charts, including stacked bar graphs, line charts, bar graphs, and doughnut charts.

5️⃣ Dashboard Creation:
Finally, I consolidated all the visualizations into a single interactive dashboard with a timeline feature, enabling the analysis of pizza sales over specific periods.

Key Insights

Orders peaked on Fridays and Saturdays.
